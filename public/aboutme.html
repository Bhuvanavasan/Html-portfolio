<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm Bhuvan — a web developer in the making, with a clear goal: to master this field and build things that actually matter.
I’m not here to just follow tutorials or blend in. I’m here to learn fast, think smart, and create work that stands out.

Right now, I’m focusing on full-stack development and strengthening my computer science foundation. I know where I’m headed, and I’m putting in the work every day to get there.

This is just the beginning. I’m building skills, building project and soon, I’ll be building impact.
